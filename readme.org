* Inference algorithms for the Poisson-Beta Model

  One idealized model for transcriptional regulation is the /telegraph model/
  (Peccoud and Ycart 1995, Raj et al. 2006, Kim and Marioni 2013, Munsky et
  al. 2013), whose steady state is described by the Poisson-Beta model. Here,
  we provide a single package implementing both previously proposed and novel
  estimation procedures for this model.
